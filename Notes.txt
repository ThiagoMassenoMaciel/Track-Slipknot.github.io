                [Intro]
                Pain
                (Here comes the pain!)

                [Verse 1]
                Enemy, show me what you wanna be
                I can handle anything even if I can't handle you
                Readily, either way, it better be
                Don't you fucking pity me, get up, get off
                What the hell am I saying? I don't know about malevolent
                Sure as hell decadent, I want somebody to step up, step off
                Walls, let me fall, fuck you all
                Get a grip, don't let me slip till I drop the ball

                [Chorus]
                Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it, you're going down, this is a war
                Fuck it!

                [Verse 2]
                Who the fuck am I to criticize your twisted state of mind?
                You're leaving me suspect, I'm leaving you grotesque
                Feels like a burn from which you never learn
                Cause and effect you jealous ass, press your face against the glass, suffer

                [Chorus]
                Fuck this shit, I'm sick of it, you're going down, this is a war
                Go

                [Bridge]
                I've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
                I've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
                I've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
                I've just begun, it's about that time, gotta get mine
                You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
                You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
                You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you
                You can't kill me 'cause I'm already inside you

                [Outro]
                Sick, sick, sick, sick
                Yeah
    3  Eyeless
            [Intro]
            Yeah!

            [Verse 1]
            Insane, am I the only motherfucker with a brain?
            I'm hearing voices but all they do is complain
            How many times have you wanted to kill
            Everything and everyone, say you'll do it but never will

            [Chorus]
            You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
            Can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
            You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes

            [Verse 2]
            I am my father's son
            'Cause he's a phantom, a mystery and that leaves me nothing!
            How many times have you wanted to die?
            It's too late for me, all you have to do is get rid of me!

            [Chorus]
            You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
            Can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
            You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes

            [Post-Chorus]
            It's all in your head
            It's all in my head
            It's all in your head
            Yeah!

            [Verse 3]
            I tried, you lied to me for so long
            Everywhere I go, there's a sense of it
            Freak on my antics and give me a choice
            Doesn't matter if I give a shit, it's shit that you gave me

            [Chorus]
            You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
            Can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes
            You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyes

            [Post-Chorus]
            It's all in your head
            It's all in my head
            It's all in your head
            Yeah!

            [Bridge]
            Do you wanna feel pain? Takin' my name in vain
            Caring never felt so lame inside
            Anybody else got pride? Do you wanna take my life?
            Maybe I'll reverse my ride
            Who the fuck are you? Fuck you!
            Better suck it up 'cause you bled
            through
            Better get away
            from me
            Stay the fuck away from me

            [Outro]
            I feel safe; seems you're saved
            I feel safe; seems you're saved
            Look me in my brand new eye
            Look me in my brand new eye
            Look me in my brand new eye
            Motherfucker!
            Look me in my brand new eye
            Look me in my brand new eye
            Look me in my brand new eye
            Look me in my brand new…
    4  Wait and Bleed
                [Chorus]
                I've felt the hate rise up in me
                Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
                I wander out where you can't see
                Inside my shell
                , I wait and bleed

                I've felt the hate rise up in me
                Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
                I wander out where you can't see
                Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

                [Post-Chorus]
                Goodbye

                [Verse 1]
                I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time
                Everything is 3D blasphemy
                My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up
                This is not the way I pictured me
                I can't control my shakes, how the hell did I get here?
                Something about this, so very wrong
                I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this
                Is it a dream or a memory?

                [Chorus]
                I've felt the hate rise up in me
                Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
                I wander out where you can't see
                Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

                [Verse 2]
                Get outta my head 'cause I don't need this, why didn't I see this?
                But I'm a victim, Manchurian candidate
                I have sinned by just
                Making my mind up and taking your breath away

                [Chorus]
                I've felt the hate rise up in me
                Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
                I wander out where you can't see
                Inside my shell, I wait and bleed
                I've felt the hate rise up in me
                Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
                I wander out where you can't see
                Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

                [Post-Chorus]
                Goodbye!

                [Bridge]
                You haven't learned a thing
                I haven't changed a thing
                The flesh was in my bones
                The pain was always free
                You haven't learned a thing
                I haven't changed a thing
                The flesh was in my bones
                The pain was always free

                [Chorus]
                I've felt the hate rise up in me
                Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
                I wander out where you can't see
                Inside my shell, I wait and bleed
                I've felt the hate rise up in me
                Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves
                I wander out where you can't see
                Inside my shell, I wait and bleed

                [Outro]
                And it waits for you
    5  Surfacing
                [Intro]
                Fuck you all!

                [Verse 1]
                Running out of ways to run
                I can't see, I can't be
                Over and over and under my skin
                All this attention is doing me in

                [Chorus]
                Fuck it all, fuck this world!
                Fuck everything that you stand for!
                Don't belong, don't exist!
                Don't give a shit, don't ever judge me!

                [Verse 2]
                Picking through the parts exposed
                Taking shape, taking shag
                Over and over and under my skin
                All this momentum is doing me in

                [Chorus]
                Fuck it all, fuck this world!
                Fuck everything that you stand for!
                Don't belong, don't exist!
                Don't give a shit, don't ever judge me!
                And don't you fucking judge me!
                Burn!

                [Bridge]
                You got all my love, living in your own hate
                Dripping hole man, hard step, no fate
                Show you nothing, but I ain't holding back
                Every damn word I say is a sneak attack
                When I get my hands on you
                Ain't a fucking thing you can do
                Get this 'cause you're never gonna get me
                I am the very disease
                you pretend
                to be
                I am the push that makes you move
                I am the push that makes you move
                I am the push that makes you move
                I am the push that makes you move

                [Chorus]
                Fuck it all, fuck this world!
                Fuck everything that you stand for!
                Don't belong, don't exist!
                Don't give a shit, don't ever judge me!
                Fuck it all, fuck this world!
                Fuck everything that you stand for!
                Don't belong, don't exist!
                Don't give a shit, don't ever judge me!
                Burn!
    6  Spit It Out
            [Intro]
            Did you never give a damn in the first place?
            Maybe it's time you had the tables turned
            'Cause in the interest of all involved, I got the problem solved
            And the verdict is guilty…

            [Verse 1]
            Man nearly killed me, steppin' where you fear to tread
            Stop, drop and roll - you were dead from the git-go!
            Big mouth fucker, stupid cocksucker
            Are you scared of me now? Then you're dumber than I thought
            Always is, and never was
            Foundation made of piss and vinegar
            Step to me, I'll smear ya - think I fear you? Bullshit!
            Just another dumb punk chompin' at this tit
            Is there any way to break through the noise?
            Was it something that I said that got you bent?
            Gotta be that way if you want it
            Sanity, literal
            profanity - hit me!

            [Chorus]
            Spit it out
            All you wanna do is drag me down
            All I wanna do is stamp you out
            Spit it out
            All you wanna do is drag me down
            All I wanna do is stamp you out

            [Verse 2]
            Maybe it's the way you gotta spread a lot of rumor fodder
            Keepin' all your little spies and leavin' when you realize
            Step up, fairy
            I guess it's time to bury your ass with the chrome straight to the dome
            You heard me right, bitch, I didn't stutter
            And if you know what's good just shut up and beg, brother
            Backstab - don't you know who you're dissin'?
            Sideswipe - we know the ass that you're kissin'!

            [Verse 3]
            Biggity-biggidy bitch boy, halfway houser
            Don't hear shit 'cause it keeps gettin' louder
            Come up and you get a face full o' tactic
            Lippin' off hard, goin' home in a basket
            You got no pull, no power, no nothin'
            Now you start shit? Well ain't that somethin'?
            Payoffs don't protect, and you can hide if you want
            But I'll find you - comin' up behind you!

            [Chorus]
            Spit it out
            All you wanna do is drag me down
            All I wanna do is stamp you out
            Spit it out
            All you wanna do is drag me down
            All I wanna do is stamp you out

            [Bridge]
            'Bout time I set this record straight
            All the needlenose punchin' is makin' me irate
            Sick o' my bitchin' fallin' on deaf ears
            Where you gonna be in the next five years?
            The crew and all the fools and all the politics
            Get your lips ready, gonna gag, gonna make you sick
            You got dick when they passed out the good stuff
            Bam - are you sick of me? Good enough - had enough
            Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
            Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
            Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
            Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
            Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
            Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
            Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!
            Fuck me! I'm all out of enemies!

            [Chorus]
            Spit it out
            All you wanna do is drag me down
            All I wanna do is stamp you out
            Spit it out
            All you wanna do is drag me down
            All I wanna do is stamp you out

            [Outro]
            Spit
            Spit
            Spit
            Spit
            Spit it out

                My floors are burning down
                (Tattered & torn)
                And I can't find a window

                [Verse 2]

                This is medieval

                Melodramatic

                [Verse 3]
                (Tattered & torn)
                Driven to the verge of

                I make you my enemy

                The nerves you sever
                (Tattered & torn)
                Can serve you better

                [Verse 4]

                In the blink of an eye

                In the space of a second

                Tearing myself apart
                From the things that make me…

                Tearing myself apart
                From the things that make me hurt
                Tearing myself apart

            [Verse]
            Go on, what about the boy?
            She lay as though she were in a trance
            With her long eyelashes fluttering like she was dreaming
            She said to him "I lie beyond the sea"
            And then all of a sudden her head dipped back, and she vanished
            Gone, gone without a trace
            A tuohtiw enog, enog
            She's never coming back
            Do you know what it's like to live with that?
            No one knows what it's like
            The only one who knew me, gone
            I know what you want, and I can give it to you
            So tired
            So tired and hungry
            Tired
            Have you ever seen God?
    9  Purity
            [Verse 1]
            Maze, psychopathic daze, I create this waste
            Back away
            from tangents, on the verge of drastic ways
            Can't escape this place, I deny your face
            Sweat gets in my eyes, I think I'm slowly dying
            Put me in a homemade cellar
            Put me in a hole for shelter
            Someone hear me please, all I see is hate
            I can hardly breathe and I can hardly take it

            [Pre-Chorus]
            Hands on my face overbearing I can't get out
            Hands on my face overbearing I can't

            [Verse 2]
            Lost, run at my own cost, hearing laughter, scoffed
            Learning from the rush, detached from such and such
            Bleak, all around me, weak listening, incomplete
            I am not a dog, but I'm the one you're dogging
            I am in a buried kennel
            I have never felt so final
            Someone find me please, losing all reserve
            I'm fucking gone, I think I'm fucking dying

            [Pre-Chorus]
            Hands on my face overbearing I can't get out
            Hands on my face overbearing I can't

            [Chorus]
            You all stare, but you'll never see
            There's something inside me
            You all stare, but you'll never see
            There's something inside me
            You all stare, but you'll never see
            There's something inside me
            You all stare, but you'll never see
            There's something in you I despise

            [Bridge]
            Cut me, show me, enter
            I am willing and able and never any danger to myself
            Knowledge in my pain, knowledge in my pain
            Or was my tolerance a phase?
            Empathy
            , out of my way
            I can't die
            I can't die
            I can't die
            I can't die

            [Chorus]
            You all stare, but you'll never see
            There's something inside me
            You all stare, but you'll never see
            There's something inside me
            You all stare, but you'll never see
            There's something inside me
            You all stare, but you'll never see
            There's something in you I despise

                Liberate my madness
                (One of me, all of you)
                Liberate my madness

                Liberate my madness!

                [Verse 1]
                Section off myself
                Put a wall up, what the hell have I done?
                Keep the dog at bay
                Survive by saving me
                Values and the game
                Not a fuck-up, not a part of your lie
                I am one, I am all, I'm above and beyond

                [Pre-Chorus]
                Stand off of the shit
                Back off or I'll spit
                So soft, you forget
                (Your garbage in is garbage out)
                You don't give a shit
                I won't play the fit
                Get off, get on this

                (One of me, all of you)
                Liberate my madness

                [Verse 2]
                I am not ashamed
                What is vital isn't always humane
                You can break in vain
                But you can't break away
                Even in my face
                Lot of bullshit, not a lotta the truth
                I can't see from here
                But I can smell your fear

                [Pre-Chorus]
                Back off of the shit
                Stand off or I'll spit
                So soft, you forget
                (Your garbage in is garbage out)
                You don't give a shit
                I won't play the fit
                Get off, get on this

                Saved, you're such a slave
                , I don't expect a name
                You don't care, I wasn't witness, I can't be a part of a system such as this
                Hard eyes glow right in my darkness again with the sickness
                Renegade sisters, blisters, salivate, litigate, liberate
                Madness, sadness, fuck this, how long have I had this?
                I don't need this outta my business
                Insert, engage, betrayed, my God
                Fraud!
                Fraud!
                Fraud!

                Even if you run, I will find you

                than I thought
                Keep in mind, I'm with you

                You laughed, your fingers clenched
                Too perfect, far too careless

                [Intro]
                My freedom is best
                Whole country's on house arrest
                And everyone's a suspect
                You can't feel the flow because you died
                Face down on a "suicide"
                The motherfucker's on self-destruct
                Nobody guardin' your back, it's all a front
                Save this! My rage is bliss!
                I'm takin' names and gettin' pissed!

                [Verse 1]
                Where's Chuck D when ya need him?
                You ain't shit, just a puddle on the bed spread
                The maniac psycho
                Cool J screamed the shit but I still can't believe it
                Man, it's funny that you scare me so
                Just enough to fuck me up again and again
                Hard life is hard as hell
                Better back the fuck on up
                'Cause this is…

                [Chorus]
                No kind of life! This is no kind of life!
                (I've got to get out)
                It's no kind of life! This is no kind of life!

                Can't be real no more, your mask is skin and bone
                Savor every flavor you got 'cause it's not your own
                Bad-ass at bat, man
                Forget about the battle, it's the war we gotta win
                Breathe, amer-cult, breathe! One more seethe!
                Freak like you gotta pair, won't be my fault
                When you're painted in the corner of a no-good life
                This is…

                [Chorus]
                No kind of life! This is no kind of life!
                (I've got to get out)
                It's no kind of life! This is no kind of life!
                (You can't blame me)

                [Bridge]
                I can't remember, I don't understand
                Is it malice that makes you this way?
                Carry it with you 'til someone forgives you
                I laugh 'cause there's nothing to say
                You can't begin to consider the palpable hate
                In the air when you're here
                None of us wonder what weather you're under
                You're making it perfectly clear

                [Verse 3]
                Lights ain't on, shit ain't right
                Never had peace but I gotta fight
                Can you look in my eyes when my back's against the wall?
                Slash at my eyes, surprise, you'll never get me
                You're all reality and sound bites
                And the freedom is never in plain sight
                The feelings, the question
                The price is too human for fucking sake
                This is…

                [Chorus]
                No kind of life! This is no kind of life!
                (I've got to get out)
                It's no kind of life! This is no kind of life!
                (You can't blame me)

                [Outro]
                I can't be!
                I can't be!
                I can't be blamed!

            Destaques: “People=Shit”, “Disasterpiece”, “My Plague”

            O álbum foi lançado dia 28 de agosto, 2001 o mais violento da banda. Corey no ápice vocal que há época simplesmente gritava o máximo possível, o que causou danos em suas        cordas vocais, a banda exalando ódio… outra obra de arte.

            “(515)” código de área das principais cidades do estado de Iowa – EUA, com gritos de extrema dor de Sid Wilson antecede “People = 
            Shit”, outro hino de ódio da banda. Uma vez escutado o refrão da música, nunca mais é esquecido.

3:::Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) — May 25, 2004
    description 
        Destaques: “The Blister Exists”, “Vermilion”, “Opium Of The People”

        Ao contrário dos dois álbuns anteriores, este lançado em 25 de maio de 2004 houve muito mais melodia quebrando um pouco o perfil violento construido anteriormente. Já que “Iowa” forçou os vocais de Corey, precisou realizar aulas vocais para canter sem dano. Os vocais gritados eram muito agudos.
        As percussões são menos notáveis neste álbum , ou seja, a característica dele, é muito mais focado em sons agudos do que em graves.

4::::All Hope Is Gone — August 26, 2008

    description
            Destaques: “Gematria (The Killing Name)”, “Psychosocial”, “Sulfur”

            Acompanhando a banda desde o final de 2010, observava vários comentários negativos em relação ao All Hope Is Gone, porém, considero injustos porque por mais que as mais famosas “Dead Memories”, “Psychosocial” e “Sulfur” sejam boas, ainda tem muitas excelentes.

            Encerrando com a violenta e barulhenta faixa-título, “All Hope Is Gone” é um álbum muito subestimado e marcado muito por “Psychosocial”. Vamos lá, o CD não é só essa música! Tristemente este foi o último álbum a contar com os membros originais Paul Gray e Joey Jordison, presentes desde as bandas anteriores à formação do Slipknot e atuaram no MFKR.

5::: .5: The Gray Chapter — October 21, 2014
    description 
        Destaques: “Sarcastrophe”, “Skeptic”, “The Negative One”
                
        Lançado no dia 21 de outubro de 2014 , este foi o álbum que fez Slipknot virar uma megabanda, apenas comparando que não foi a banda principal de festivais como o Sonisphere 2011, que o Iron Maiden era a principal e o Rock in Rio 2011, tocando antes de Metallica. 
                
        Em 2015, ano subsequente a este lançamento, Slipknot simplesmente foi headliner dos maiores festivais: Hellfest, Download, Rock In Rio, Soundwave, Rock Am Ring, Rock Im Park entre outros.

6::We Are Not Your Kind — August 9, 2019

    discriptions
            Destaques: “Nero Forte”, “Orphan”, “Solway Firth”
              Ano de lançamento dia 9 de agosto de 2019 . Com uma atmosfera um pouco conturbada tendo em vista a saída de Chris Fehn da banda
              No geral, We Are Not Your Kind não é um álbum bom, poucas músicas acabam sendo realmente boas. “Interludes” estranhos como “Death Because Of Death”, “What’s Next” (música de elevador) acabam causando bastante estranheza, mas, em compensação, após “Death Because Of Death” tem a absurda “Nero Forte” que é uma das melhores músicas da banda. Pesada, riff brutal, refrão incrível.
              “Orphan”, uma das mais brutais da carreira da banda, com pedal duplo muito rápido e guitarras que lembram o (literalmente) hino “The Heretic Anthem” (Anthem é hino em inglês).
              o álbum se encerra com “Solway Firth”, outra música que também é uma das mais brutais da banda, com EXCELENTE pedal duplo, uma voz absurda do Corey.

7:The End, So Far — September 30, 2022

    descriptions 
            Destaques: “The Dying Song (Time To Sing)”, “Hive Mind”, “Warranty”
              
            Ano de lançamento dia 9 de agosto de 2019 .Já o álbum se inicia com “Aderall” é nada a ver com o estilo mais popular da banda.
              
            “Hive Mind” e “Warranty” são excelentes e merecem estar no top 3. Pesadas, ótimos refrões, perfeitas para escutar repetidamente. Porém, as duas seguintes “Medicine For The Dead” e “Acidic” já são mais “chatinhas”. Elas têm bons momentos, mas, em geral, são completamente “puláveis”.
            
            Apesar de, em “fóruns” na internet sobre a banda, os fãs tratarem o “The End, So Far”, inferiormente ao “We Are Not Your Kind”, o geral das músicas mostra que o lançamento de 2022 é muito superior e tem músicas que são ótimas para ouvir repetidamente e ouvir do início ao fim é menos sofrível que o de 2019.
